            <p class="pp">Let’s imagine a developer’s life without limits.
                What would we be able to accomplish if we were not victims of time pressure, blockers, inherited code
                bases, political games or economic distress?
                What if we could dedicate all the time in the world to design and build our solutions with no
                dependencies blocking our way. Just a clean slate sprinkled with hope and glory in a perfectly
                functional organisation surrounded by magic money trees..</p>

            <p class="pp">If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer
                community.
                There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support,
                sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more. </p>
